This is a repository of the scripts that were used to conduct gene regulatory network analysis for the manuscript entitled: Bioenergy sorghum stem intercalary meristem localization, imaging, and developmental transcriptome dynamics.

The script works with gene level data, not trasncript level data, so if your data is in transcripts I have also included another R script for summing TPM values or count values in a dataset. 

The R script and the associated files are for running gene regulatory on Sorghum bicolor transcriptome data. This workflow could be adapted to other systems but the associated files would have to be changed.
