This is a repository of the scripts that were used to conduct gene regulatory network analysis for the manuscript entitled: Bioenergy sorghum stem intercalary meristem localization, imaging, and developmental transcriptome dynamics.

The script works with gene level data only, not transcript level data. If your data is in transcripts, I have also included another R script for summing TPM values or count values in a dataset. 

Next, in order to slim down the set of genes to a more manageable size, differential expression analysis with edgeR was performed. The edgeR script used is included in the repository.

SYM_np_vs_wb_DE_GRN.cys is a Cytoscape file that where the network can be visualized and queried.
